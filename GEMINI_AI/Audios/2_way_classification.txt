This problem requires a two-way ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) to determine if there are significant differences in gas mileage bet
ween gasoline brands and automobile models.  Here's a step-by-step guide on how to approach this using statistical software (like
 R, SPSS, or SAS) or a calculator with ANOVA capabilities.  I'll outline the process and interpret the results conceptually, as t
he specific calculations are best done with software.

**Step 1: State the Hypotheses**

* **For Gasoline Brands:**
    * Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no significant difference in mean gas mileage between the three gasoline brands.
    * Alternative Hypothesis (H1): There is a significant difference in mean gas mileage between at least two of the gasoline bra
nds.

* **For Automobile Models:**
    * Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no significant difference in mean gas mileage between the four automobile models.
    * Alternative Hypothesis (H1): There is a significant difference in mean gas mileage between at least two of the automobile m
odels.


**Step 2: Choose a Significance Level (α)**

The significance level (alpha) is typically set at 0.05. This means we are willing to accept a 5% chance of rejecting the null hy
pothesis when it is actually true (Type I error).

**Step 3: Perform Two-Way ANOVA**

This is where statistical software is essential.  Input your data into the software, specifying that it's a two-way ANOVA with "G
asoline Brand" and "Automobile Model" as the factors.  The software will perform the calculations and provide you with an ANOVA t
able.  A typical ANOVA table will look like this:

| Source of Variation | Sum of Squares (SS) | Degrees of Freedom (df) | Mean Square (MS) | F-statistic | P-value |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Gasoline Brand      | SS_Brand             | df_Brand               | MS_Brand             | F_Brand       | P_Brand   |       
| Automobile Model    | SS_Model             | df_Model               | MS_Model             | F_Model       | P_Model   |       
| Interaction          | SS_Interaction       | df_Interaction         | MS_Interaction       | F_Interaction | P_Interaction |  
| Error                | SS_Error             | df_Error               | MS_Error             |              |           |       
| Total                | SS_Total             | df_Total               |                    |              |           |

**Calculating Degrees of Freedom (df):**

* df_Brand = Number of brands - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2
* df_Model = Number of models - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3
* df_Interaction = df_Brand * df_Model = 2 * 3 = 6
* df_Error = (Number of brands * Number of models) - (Number of brands + Number of models -1) = (3*4) - (3+4-1) = 6
* df_Total = Total number of observations - 1 = 12 - 1 = 11


**Step 4: Interpret the Results**

The crucial values in the ANOVA table are the F-statistics and their corresponding p-values for Gasoline Brand, Automobile Model,
 and their Interaction.

* **P-value for Gasoline Brand (P_Brand):** If P_Brand < α (0.05), you reject the null hypothesis for gasoline brands. This means
 there's a statistically significant difference in gas mileage between at least two of the gasoline brands.

* **P-value for Automobile Model (P_Model):** If P_Model < α (0.05), you reject the null hypothesis for automobile models. This m
eans there's a statistically significant difference in gas mileage between at least two of the automobile models.

* **P-value for Interaction (P_Interaction):**  If P_Interaction < α (0.05), it suggests that the effect of gasoline brand on gas
 mileage depends on the automobile model (and vice-versa).  In simpler terms, the differences in gas mileage between brands are n
ot consistent across all models. This is an important finding, as it shows that the main effects (brands and models) should be in
terpreted cautiously in the presence of a significant interaction.


**Step 5: Post-Hoc Tests (If Necessary)**

If you reject the null hypothesis for either gasoline brands or automobile models, you'll likely want to perform post-hoc tests (
like Tukey's HSD or Bonferroni) to determine *which* specific groups (brands or models) differ significantly from each other.  Th
ese tests control for the increased chance of Type I error when making multiple comparisons.  Your statistical software will offe
r these options.


**In summary:**  Use statistical software to perform the two-way ANOVA.  Focus on the p-values in the ANOVA table to determine st
atistical significance. Remember to interpret the interaction effect carefully, as it can modify your interpretation of the main 
effects.  Post-hoc tests will help pinpoint specific differences between groups if significant effects are found.
