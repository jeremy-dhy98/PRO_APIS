This problem requires a two-way ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) to determine if there are signif
icant differences in gas mileage due to gasoline brand and/or automobile model.  Here's a ste
p-by-step guide:

**1. State the Hypotheses:**

* **For Gasoline Brands:**
    * H₀ (Null Hypothesis): There is no significant difference in mean gas mileage among the 
three gasoline brands.
    * H₁ (Alternative Hypothesis): There is a significant difference in mean gas mileage amon
g the three gasoline brands.

* **For Automobile Models:**
    * H₀ (Null Hypothesis): There is no significant difference in mean gas mileage among the 
four automobile models.
    * H₁ (Alternative Hypothesis): There is a significant difference in mean gas mileage amon
g the four automobile models.


**2. Set the Significance Level (α):**

Typically, a significance level of α = 0.05 is used. This means we're willing to accept a 5% 
chance of rejecting the null hypothesis when it's actually true (Type I error).


**3. Perform the Two-Way ANOVA:**

This is best done using statistical software (like R, SPSS, SAS, or even Excel's Data Analysi
s Toolpak).  The software will calculate the following:

* **Sum of Squares (SS):**  This measures the variation in the data.  You'll have SS for gaso
line brands (SSB), SS for automobile models (SSM), SS for the interaction between brands and 
models (SSBM), and SS for error (SSE).
* **Degrees of Freedom (df):**  These are related to the number of groups and observations.  
    * df for brands (dfB) = number of brands - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2
    * df for models (dfM) = number of models - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3
    * df for interaction (dfBM) = dfB * dfM = 2 * 3 = 6
    * df for error (dfE) = (number of brands * number of models) - number of brands - number 
of models + 1 = (3*4) - 3 - 4 + 1 = 6
    * df total = total number of observations - 1 = 12 - 1 = 11

* **Mean Squares (MS):**  This is calculated by dividing the SS by the df.  MS = SS/df (MSB, 
MSM, MSBM, MSE)

* **F-statistic:** This is the ratio of the mean squares for each factor (brands and models) 
to the mean square error.
    * FB = MSB / MSE
    * FM = MSM / MSE

* **p-values:** The p-value for each F-statistic indicates the probability of observing the d
ata if the null hypothesis is true.


**4. Interpret the Results:**

* **Gasoline Brands:** Compare the p-value for the F-statistic (FB) to your significance leve
l (α = 0.05).
    * If the p-value is less than α (p < 0.05), reject the null hypothesis.  There is a stati
stically significant difference in gas mileage among the gasoline brands.
    * If the p-value is greater than or equal to α (p ≥ 0.05), fail to reject the null hypoth
esis. There is not enough evidence to conclude a significant difference in gas mileage among 
the brands.

* **Automobile Models:** Compare the p-value for the F-statistic (FM) to your significance le
vel (α = 0.05).  Interpret similarly to the gasoline brands.

* **Interaction:**  The p-value associated with the interaction term (SSBM) tells you if the 
effect of gasoline brand depends on the automobile model (and vice-versa).  A significant int
eraction means the effect of one factor depends on the level of the other.


**5.  Example using R (Statistical Software):**


First, you need to enter the data into R.  A good way to do this is with a data frame:       

```R
data <- data.frame(
  Brand = factor(rep(c("1", "2", "3"), each = 4)),
  Model = factor(rep(c("I", "II", "III", "IV"), times = 3)),
  Mileage = c(32.4, 28.8, 36.5, 34.4, 35.6, 28.6, 37.6, 36.2, 38.7, 29.9, 39.1, 37.9)        
)

model <- aov(Mileage ~ Brand + Model + Brand:Model, data = data)
summary(model)
```

The `summary(model)` command will provide the ANOVA table with the F-statistics and p-values 
you need to make your conclusions.


Remember to carefully interpret the output from your chosen software.  The ANOVA table will g
ive you the necessary F-statistics and p-values to determine statistical significance.  If th
ere's a significant interaction effect, you'll need to explore the data further (perhaps with
 post-hoc tests) to understand the nature of the interaction.
