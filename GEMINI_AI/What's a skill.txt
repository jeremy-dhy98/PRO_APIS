A skill is the learned ability to perform a task or activity with proficiency and efficiency.  It's more than just knowledge; it's the *application* of knowledge and experience to consistently produce a desired outcome.  Several key aspects define a skill:

* **Learned:** Skills aren't innate; they're acquired through practice, training, or experience.  While some people may have a natural aptitude for certain skills, they still require deliberate effort to develop.

* **Proficiency:** Skilled individuals can perform the task well, accurately, and effectively. This involves both speed and accuracy.

* **Efficiency:**  Skillful execution minimizes wasted effort and resources. It's about achieving the desired outcome with the least amount of time, energy, and materials.

* **Consistency:**  A true skill allows for reliable and repeatable performance.  A skilled individual can consistently produce similar results over time.

* **Transferable (often):** Many skills are transferable, meaning they can be applied to different contexts or tasks.  For example, problem-solving skills are useful in many areas of life.

* **Improvement over time:** Skills are not static; they improve with continued practice and feedback.  The more you practice a skill, the better you become at it.


In short, a skill is a developed competency that allows for proficient and efficient performance of a specific task or activity.  It's a combination of knowledge, ability, and practice resulting in a demonstrable capability.
